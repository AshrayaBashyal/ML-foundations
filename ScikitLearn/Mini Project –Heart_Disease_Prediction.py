# We’ll use the classic Heart Disease dataset (UCI Cleveland).
# It has columns like:
# age, sex, cp (chest pain type),
# trestbps (resting blood pressure),
# chol (cholesterol),
# thalach (max heart rate),
# target → 1 = disease, 0 = no disease.

# Goal:

# Load and clean a healthcare dataset

# Train Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, k-NN

# Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall

# Compare results

# Train all 3 models and compare metrics.
# Try different hyperparameters:
# max_depth for DecisionTree
# n_neighbors for k-NN
# penalty or C for Logistic Regression
# Which model gives the best tradeoff between accuracy, precision, recall?
# Bonus: Plot a bar chart of accuracy scores for all models.
