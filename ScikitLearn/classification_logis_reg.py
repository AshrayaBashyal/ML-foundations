# Classification with Logistic Regression
# Regression → predicts continuous values (house price, exam score).
# Classification → predicts discrete labels (spam / not spam, sick / healthy, pass / fail).

# Logistic Regression Idea
# It predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function:

# 𝜎(𝑧)=1/(1+e)^(-z)

# Output is between 0 and 1 (probability).
# If probability > 0.5 → class 1
# Else → class 0
